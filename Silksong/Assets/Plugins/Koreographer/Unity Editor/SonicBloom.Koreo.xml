                <para>The Koreographer is the object responsible for triggering events.  It takes the current music
            point, querries the Koreography for events at those times, and then sends cues to "actors" that
            are listening for directions.</para>
                <para>This setup *does not* stop an "actor" from looking directly at a specific Koreography Track.
            This is fully supported.  It just means that that actor will only get cues for the Tracks for
            which it has registered.</para>
                <para>The music is "reported" to the Koreographer.  In this sense, the Koreographer "Hears" the
            music.</para>
                <para>The Koreographer manages a list of Koreography.  These are considered "loaded" and any
            time the associated music is played, their events are triggered.</para>
                <para>When Koreography is loaded, the Koreographer finds-or-adds a string-&gt;EventObj mapping to a managed
            list.  This allows the Koreographer to get notified when Koreography Events occur directly from the
            triggered tracks.  The events are then automatically forwarded to those who registered for
            such events with the Koreographer.</para>

            The SimpleMusicPlayer component plays audio using Koreography.  Instead of
            taking an <c>AudioClip</c> reference, it takes a single Koreography reference.
            At runtime, the Koreography is loaded into the static Koreographer Instance.

            (or configured number of buffers) has been _read_ but _before_ that
            buffer (those buffers) could be _refilled_. This "fuzz-factor" gives
            a small amount of buffer-relative leeway to the estimation system,
